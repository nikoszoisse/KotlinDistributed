# KotlinDistributed
A project that uses both Kotlin and AKKA framework to build a fault tolerant distributed IOT system. 

AKKA is a popular framework for building concurrent, distributed, and resilient applications in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) ecosystem. It provides tools and libraries for building actor-based systems, which can be used to design and implement scalable and fault-tolerant systems.

Kotlin is a modern programming language that is fully compatible with the JVM and can be used to develop applications for the JVM, including those built with AKKA. Many developers find Kotlin to be a concise and expressive language that makes it easier to write code that is easy to read, maintain, and debug.

In general, using AKKA with Kotlin can be a good choice for building distributed and concurrent systems.
